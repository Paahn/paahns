A little about me

I'm a fullstack developer based in Beautiful British Columbia, Canada. I graduated from Lighthouse Labs in February 2020 from the Web Developer program. I enjoy challenging myself and learning new technologies in the process. I am most comfortable when I describe an issue in math terminology. In every other case, you can bet I am debugging with a colleague or a rubber duck. I occasionally publish tech related articles to Medium.
